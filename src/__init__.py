"""Helper to make ``mcpm`` importable when the package is used in *editable*
mode (i.e. when running directly from the repository root).

The source-code resides in *src/mcpm/*.  Production installations add the
package to *sys.path* via standard packaging mechanisms so ``import mcpm``
works out-of-the-box.  The unit tests, however, import modules using the
namespace package form (``import src.mcpmâ€¦``) which leaves the top-level
module name ``mcpm`` undefined.  We therefore insert an alias into
``sys.modules`` so that absolute imports inside the code-base continue to
resolve correctly.

import sys as _sys


# When *src.mcpm* is imported, the module instance is available under that key
# in ``sys.modules``.  We create a second entry pointing to the same object so
# that ``import mcpm`` works as expected.
# Ensure that the *src* directory itself is on ``sys.path`` so that
# ``import mcpm`` resolves to the local sources during in-repository
# execution (the normal packaging mechanism handles this when the project is
# installed in site-packages).
